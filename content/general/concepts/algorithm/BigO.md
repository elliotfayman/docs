Title: 'Big-O Notation'
Description: 'An algorithm is a formal process used to solve a problem. To compare two algorithms, it is necessary to develop tools to evaluate algorithmic efficiency. This comparison is very important since while many algorithms might function in the same way, they may also consume a differing amount of resources. It is often best practice to limit the footprint of the algorithms that are developed and to do that, Big-O notation is to be used. '

Big-O notation is a form of measuring the complexity of an algorithm. This can take the form of a time complexity analysis or a space complexity analysis. At times, an algorithm can be refactored or reworked to achieve a more efficient time and space complexity. To describe the time or space complexity, two different notations are used: big omega notation and big-O. Big omega describes the best running case scenario while big-O describes the worst case scenario. 

## Common Runtimes

Here are some common runtimes:

- Polynomial time: If the time is a power of the input size.
  - Bubble sort has quadratic time complexity.
- Linear time: If the time is proportional to the input size.
  - The traverse of a list.
- Logarithmic time: If the time is a logarithmic function of the input size.
  - Binary search algorithm.
- Constant time: If the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size.
  - An access to an array element.

## Simplifying Big-O Expressions

When determining an expression that charecterizes the time or space complexity of an algorithm, you may find that your expression contains multiple terms. For example: O(n) + O(ln(n)). In this situation, it is best practice to drop all of the lower order terms so the big-O notation would simplify into just O(n).

## Python Big-O Practice

```
# Example function
def foo(list1, list2):
    for item in list1:
        for item2 in list2:
            print("*")
```

Big-O Notation: $O(n^{2})$
